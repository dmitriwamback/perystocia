                <div id="product-name">Day of Armistice
                    <div id="product-description">Day of Armistice is set in a dystopian future following the Anopol Peace Treaty of 2101, which divided the Federation of Vjsda. The treaty has led to economic recession, geopolitical disputes, and governance issues, sparking revolutions in Mnizh, M'vniki, and Umnsk. Vjsda and Perijstocia were involved in orchestrating conflicts abroad, further destabilizing the region.</span></div>
                    <div id="product-description">Geopolitics plays a role therein. The political rhetoric has shifted from Vjsda to Perijstocia as the sole governing "police" of the region. The inauguration of SWAH'G and SRSQ plagues the region with sophisticated terrorist attacks that threaten global peace.</span></div>
                    <div id="product-description">The government of Perijstocia, under the secretive QDR, uses a range of tactics and schemes to coerce any foreign political ambition that goes against Perijstocia's narrative. The partition of Azortozha's capital Rivynskgorod accorded by the Treaty of Gorovask 1940 caused violent resistance against Perijstocia with the rise of RJOTA.</span></div>
                    <div id="product-description">From February 2nd to March 4th 2103, Perijstocia holds its 2nd anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Anopol. But this time, regional events - including terrorism - challenge Perijstocia's use of diplomacy, military strategy, foreign affairs and espionage as a weapon of destabilization.</span></div>
                    <div id="product-description">Perijstocia's narrative uses conflicting information to silence its people. It deletes the memories of citizens with implanted cognitive chips that have a view outside of QDR's reach.</span></div>

                <div id="info-description" style="white-space:pre-line;">
                    Originating from the Al-Raya al-Khadra group, SRSQ (Sovereign Republic of Snzaq and Qair) wishes to separate from Snzaq, Gzodet and Qair and form their own state.
                </div>
                <div id="info-description" style="white-space:pre-line;">
                    Since the end of the 1980s, the country of Snzaq was governed by the Liga Spravedlivosti Party. In the decades to come, the vast desertic states of the east of the country: Al-Mahjar, Nahran, and Qadira all fell into drought. The eastern states became disconnected with the rest of the Federation of Snzaq. Piracy and terrorism ensued in the region without help of ever gaining nation-wide recognition.
                </div>
                <div id="info-description" style="white-space:pre-line;">
                    Al-Raya al-Khadra, formed in Nahran in 2001, started as a political party who sought diplomatic and economic ties with the majority Liga Spravedlivosti Party. Slowly, the gap between the central government and the militants in the east narrowed and peace would be "guaranteed".
                </div>
                <div id="info-description" style="white-space:pre-line;">
                    Qair, a more sophisticated and a more powerful country north of Snzaq, seized the historic city of Al-Hrqatyr from the western part of Gzodet. The militants who were deeply rooted in the history of the region crossed the border into Qair. Since then, terrorism spread across the regions of Qair and east Snzaq.
                </div>
                <div id="info-description" style="white-space:pre-line;">
                    With the lack of cooperation between the federal government and the militants, the states of Nahran and Al-Mahjar became de-facto independent countries. Al-Raya al-Khadra, realizing the gravity of the situation in its home states, went against the government, attempted several coup d'états and targeted civilian zones.

                <div id="info-description" style="white-space:pre-line;">
                    Founded in Perijstocia in 2010, SWAH'G was recognized under it's title as: "Social Workers Association in Hrač'gorvask". This group aimed at benefitting the proletarians who have been under suppression by the monopolies in Perijstocia.
                </div>
                <div id="info-description" style="white-space:pre-line;">
                    With the general elections taking place in March 2014 in Perijstocia, the majority party (QDR) aided SWAH'G to help tighten the labor laws against abusive work conditions. Sooner, the SWAH'G Party became more and more influential until its peak in 2090, with several new popular leaders and funding from the general public.
                </div>
                <div id="info-description" style="white-space:pre-line;">
                    As time progressed, QDR elected a corrupt leader unknown to them. In March of 2090, the QDR has become the most powerful government in Perijstocia. The new president started to kill opposition leaders, this included the infamous SWAH'G. To provoke fear within the people, Perijstocia used propaganda to indoctrinate the new generations of the country.
                </div>
                <div id="info-description" style="white-space:pre-line;">
                    As the president of Perijstocia continued to indoctrinate its people, "it" framed SWAH'G to be a foreign terrorist organisation. To amplify this claim, Perijstocia destabilized the Mnizh region of Vidsvonje, the Yokonoma region of Koryansko, and Ajort, exclaming that SWAH'G was to blame. The government of Perijstocia labeled the group: "Sovereignty of Wkrow-Arijat-Havknat'Gzeva" to reinforce the narrative of them being a separatist and terrorist entity.

                <div id="info-description" style="white-space:pre-line;">
                    In 1930, after the discovery of oil in Qal'at Hamra, Qair, QDR (Queried, Developed, Regionalized) was inaugurated to help extract oil from Qairi soil. This oriented the civilians in Qair, who were already dealing with famines, to protest against the exploitation of oil.

                <div id="info-description" style="white-space:pre-line;">
                    In the 1950s, the Qairi government invested into its agricultural sector, which aided to subside the tensions between the civilians of Qair and its government, but this didn't satisfy the ideals of Koalitsiya Pravdy.

                <div id="info-description" style="white-space:pre-line;">
                    In the mid 1990s to 2000s, the QDR transformed into a political party which aimed at securing the economy and help invest into big business. QDR's foreign ambition though were suspended after a round of attacks orchestrated by Koalitsiya Pravdy took place against several economic centers across Perijstocia from 2000-2005.

                    After the inner party nominated a new leader for the party, he invested into surveillance systems to crush down on any opposition from the scars of the past. The Party gave itself two different identities to evaluate the gullibleness of its citizens, further indoctrinating them and to freely commit terror across borders.

                    After the Treaty of Zabčrograd in 1942, the borders of Perystocja and Azortoja shifted. The citizens who lived in Vyteria and Zabčrograd were amongst a threat to the west. Perystocja's dictatorial and fascist state stole the lands inhabited by native Azortojans.
                </div>
                <div id="info-description" style="white-space:pre-line;">
                    The peace treaty not only divided Vyteria-Zabčrograd in two sectors, but it also interfered in the territory of Rivynskgorod. The city was divided with incoherent borders that separated countless families of both sides of the city. In response, an organisation seized several parts of Perystocja controlled Rivynskgorod.

                <div id="info-description" style="white-space:pre-line;">
                    The armed militia provoked several attacks within the Perystocja side of Rivynskgorod and vowed to take down the strict and weaponized border that divided the two societies. The "Freedom Perijstocia League" took over the country in 1950 and the "Tahl Movement" seized Azortoja's parliament creating the new government of Azortozha.
