                    The Treaty of Anopol 2071 has partitioned and dissolved the Federation of Vjsda. The treaty caused a financial recession, geopolitical disputes and power vacuums to erupt. Mnizh and M'vniki fell into revolutions. 
                    
                    You're given several tasks from the central government to execute your actions. These tasks include foreign affairs missions, military attacks and espionage on high-ranking individuals. Your government wants to consolidate its power; upon an "election" held in Perijstocia and Azortozha, you're tasked with several political assassinations. 
                    
                    You can go against the orders of your government, exposing risks to you and your fate. Terrorist attacks are frequent, protests in Perijstocia cause disstress in the upper class. You dictate foreign affairs and military missions. 
                    
                    Collusion is a tool used by the PCS in action. Mnizh (SWAH'G) is in collapse, but some people are skeptical. "For Perijstocia and Beyond!"</div>

                    The prosperous East Rivynskgorod, under Azortozha, sparked rebellion within the Perijstocia side of Rivynskgorod. 
                    RJOTA is a secret group who wishes to take down the heavily-guarded border to undermine the suppressive regime of Perijstocia. The mercenary group, under the abbreviation of "Rivynskgorod Junta Organization To Accession", carries out thorough attacks and sabotage along the border.
                    
                    Border crossings are closed, causing the two countries to dispute over diplomatic issues.

                <div class="default-text" id="sub-game-description">The kelptocratic regime of the newly formed Praesk Republic found itself in collapse. A domestic conflict from 1900 to 2071 in Vidsvonje left the country in ruins.

                    Independence from the Treaty of Anopol liberated the country from centuries of tension between Praesk and the inaugurated Vjsda Federation.

                    The conflict altered the perception of thought within both nations. The immense poverty and destruction of Praesk forced the government to consolidate its power.

                    Political biases, specifically those that lean towards the ideology of Vjsda, are illegal. The state despises any criticism. Any media that evokes a negative image towards the regime is erased. The country's history is rewritten according to the state.

                    The Propagandist Front and the government wish to push their own narrative on society.

                <div class="default-text" id="sub-game-description">January 1st 2150, West Corridor, a man on a seat outside in an alleyway waits patiently. A secret mafia controlled under PLL [Paquvatka Libertqua Luiviqua] in Qrou District 11 makes their way into the alleyway, of which corporate advertisements inundate the walls of buildings, with holographic figures on the streets. 
                    The streets of cities were completely covered by people, who were all dressed in early 21st century peasant clothes and masks to counter inhaling the abundance of NO<span style="font-size: 12px;">2</span> and SO<span style="font-size: 12px;">2</span> emitted by decades of pollution. Two corporations fought against each other using mass terrorism to take advantage over West Corridor. 
                    As the mafia of 5 people, wearing spiffing suits under umbrellas as the mild rain over the monorail drips onto the surface below, came in close proximity of the man, they disclosed the bureaucratic details about the intolerant regime of East Corridor.
                    The unnamed man, under the influence of the PLL, of which was on high alert in West and East Corridor, made his way into an embassy of a former country. The embassy which he entered was formerly a part of the “Democratic Republic of Perijstocia,” which many people have never heard of.</div>
